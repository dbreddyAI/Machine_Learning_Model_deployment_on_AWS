# Machine_Learning_Model_deployment_on_AWS
This is a project where a small Machine learning model is deployed on AWS.

I have created a user interface for user to input values. These values will be processed by a trained model.

To help and create enthusiasm I have given user 3 different model out of which user can choose one by using which user want to predict/tes his entered data.

About the Model---It will be described in second part

There is a provision where user can tune the result of the model by changing some parameter which affect the model result.

Here I have given provision to the user to change the value of n_estimator in Random Forest Algorithm. This value plays an importatnt role to change the performance of the model.

Let's see how the model works.
