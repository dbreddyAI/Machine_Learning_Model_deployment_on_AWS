# Machine_Learning_Model_deployment_on_AWS
This is a project where a small Machine learning model is deployed on AWS.

I have created a user interface for user to input values. These values will be processed by a trained model.

To help and create enthusiasm I have given user 3 different model out of which user can choose one by using which user want to predict/tes his entered data.

About the Model---It will be described in second part

There is a provision where user can tune the result of the model by changing some parameter which affect the model result.

Here I have given provision to the user to change the value of n_estimator in Random Forest Algorithm. This value plays an importatnt role to change the performance of the model.

Let's see how the model works.

VVIMP:
1. Create a main folder e.g. Webapp
2. Create a folder inside Webapp/model and move all .pkl files in this folder
3. Create a folder inside Webapp/templates and mode all .html files in it.
4. Keep app.py inside Webapp/

This should be directory structure. If you dont want to follow it then you have to change the path inside the py file and html files accordingly.
